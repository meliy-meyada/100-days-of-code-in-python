## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#daily
# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

#Get yesterday's closing stock price. Hint: You can perform list comprehensions on Python dictionaries. e.g. [new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items()]
stock_params = {
    "function": "TIME_SERIES_DAILY",
    "symbol": STOCK_NAME,
    "apikey": STOCK_API_KEY,

print(day_before_yesterday_closing_price)

#Work out the percentage difference in price between closing price yesterday and closing price the day before yesterday.
diff_percent = round((difference / float(yesterday_closing_price)) * 100)
print(diff_percent)


## STEP 2: https://newsapi.org/ Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME.
#Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.
#If TODO4 percentage is greater than 5 then print("Get News").

    there_articles = articles[:3]
    print(there_articles)

    ## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number.

    #Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.
    formatted_articles = [f"{STOCK_NAME}: {up_down}{diff_percent}%\nHeadline: {article['title']}. \nBrief: {article['description']}" for article in there_articles]

    #TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio.
    client = Client(TWILIO_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)
    for article in formatted_articles:
        message = client.messages.create(
            body=article,
            from_=TWILIO_NUMBER_PHONE,
            to="Your Phone Number"
        )



    #Optional Format the message like this:
"""
